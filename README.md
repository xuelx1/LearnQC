# LearnQC
 ### Continuing updating...
 Learing Quantum Computing with Qiskit.

 ### Until now includes:

 1. hello_ibm, hello_qiskit. "Hello world" in Quantum Computing, to show how to build a simple quantum circuit and run it.
 1.1. Before starting, I writed some frequently-used functions in funcs.py and test_funs.py. I will use them in the following codes.
 2. superdense coding. Use one qubit to send two bits of information.
 3. quantum teleportation. Use two classical bits to send one qubit of information.

### envs:
1. qiskit  1.1.0
2. qiskit_aer  0.14.1
3. qiskit_ibm_run  0.23.0
